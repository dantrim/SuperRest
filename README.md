# SuperRest

A RootCore package that depends on the [SusyNtuple](https://github.com/susynt) analysis package [Superflow](https://github.com/dantrim/Superflow). The emphasis for this Superflow-based package is to separate out the RestFrames analyses from the general Superflow analysis code which does not require all of the additional RestFrames libraries and installation.
